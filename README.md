Add and manipulate loading states of any element on the page.

[Docs and Demos](http://carlosbonetti.github.io/jquery-loading/).

## In development !!

This is a work in progress. Currently doing some tests and stuff. __There is no stable release available so far__, so use it at your own risk.

Give me a couple of days and it will be _shining_.
